# Displayly

This was my group project for the CIS*3750 course at the University of Guelph.

The purpose of the project was to develop a system that would be capable of displaying content on multiple displays. This sounds vague and it purposely is. The professor's goal was for all the groups to interpret that description and create a product by the end of the semester.

Our group decided to create an advertising system. We would have a website where users could login, upload images, and display those images on "advertising screens" around campus. We defined an "advertising screen" as anything that is connected to the internet and has a web browser (to display the content the advertising screen would need to contact a specific url)

## What I did

For this project, I created the entire backend/API system (in the code structure, all of the code in the `backend` folder was written by me).

NOTE: The API does not actually work outside of the University of Guelph network. Because this was a school project, we used a U of G server (which can only be accessed on the U of G network). However, the API documentation can be found here: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/5974467/RzfaqrD7 

The `frontend` folder contains all the code (written by other group members) for the website.
